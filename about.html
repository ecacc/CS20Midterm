    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <section class="about-backstory">
        <div id="about-story-content">
            <p> Our story begins with a tragedy, the worst possible kind you 
                could imagine: a disastrous dinner party. A man named Eric Kim 
                was the host, a distinguished name in the cutthroat flower-arrangement 
                business, and this was to be the most important dinner of his life. He 
                invited several guests, many of which were big investors who held the power 
                to take his business to the next level. But on this very important dinner, 
                everything went wrong: the venue was a mess, the decor was atrocious, the 
                food was inedible, and Eric's dreams of becoming the top flower-arranging 
                business in the world were dashed.</p>
            
            <p> After that night, Eric vowed to never allow any other special occasion 
                go so horribly wrong and decided on his new venture: Eventastic, an 
                all-in-one event planning service fit for the most important days of 
                your lives.</p>
